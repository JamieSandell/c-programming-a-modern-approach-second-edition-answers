Suppose that b and i are declared as follows:

enum {FALSE, TRUE} b;
int i;
Which of the following statements are legal? Which ones are "safe" (always yield a mean-
ingful result)?

(a) b = FALSE;
(b) b = i;
(c) b++;
(d) i = b;
(e) i = 2 * b + 1;

All are legal.
(a) Meaningful.
(b) Meaningless, will hold the default value of i (whatever that is).
(c) Meaningless.
(d) Meaningless.
(e) Meaningless.
