Suppose that s is the following structure (point is a structure tag declared in Exercise 10):

struct shape {
    int shape_kind;            /* RECTANGLE or CIRCLE */
    struct point center;       /* coordinates of center */
    union {
        struct {
            int height, width;
        } rectangle;
        struct {
            int radius;
        } circle;
    } u;
} s;

If the value of shape_kind is RECTANGLE, the height and width members store the
dimensions of a rectangle. If the value of shape_kind is CIRCLE, the radius member
stores the radius of a circle. Indicate which of the following statements are legal, and show
how to repair the ones that aren't:

(a) s.shape_kind = RECTANGLE;
(b) s.center.x = 10;
(c) s.height = 25;
(d) s.u.rectanlge.width = 8;
(e) s.u.circle = 5;
(f) s.u.radius = 6;

(a) Legal
(b) Legal
(c) Illegal - s.u.height = 25; (better would be to check if shape_kind is RECTANGLE first, or assuming we want to do it anyway, set shape_kind to RECTANGLE)
(d) Legal - better to check if shape_kind is RECTANLGE first, or set shape_kind to RECTANGLE as well.
(e) Illegal - s.u.circle.radius = 5 and shape_kind = CIRCLE
(f) Illegal - s.u.circle.radius = 6 and shape_kind = CIRCLE
