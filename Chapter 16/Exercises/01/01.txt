In the following declarations, the x and y structures have members named x and y:

struct { int x, y;} x;
struct { int x, y;} y;

Are these declarations legal on an individual basis? Could both declarations appear as
shown in a program? Justify your answer.

--------------

The declarations are legal on an individual basis and both could appear as shown in a program.
The member variables are scoped within their block, so x.x, x.y, and y.x and y.y are legal.
