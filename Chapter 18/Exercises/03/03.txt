external or none) of each variable and parameter in the following file:

extern float a;

void f(register double b)
{

}

(a)
storage duration = static
scope = file
linkage = external

(b)
storage duration = automatic
scope = block
linkage = none

(c)
storage duration = static
scope = block
linkage = none

(d)
storage duration = automatic
scope = block
