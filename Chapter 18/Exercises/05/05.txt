State whether each of the following statements is true or false. Justify each answer.

(a) Every variable with static storage duration has file scope.
(b) Every variable declared inside a function has no linkage.
(c) Every variable with internal linkage has static storage duration.
(d) Every parameter has block scope.

(a)
False. If it's static within a function it has block scope but static duration.

(b)
False. If it's an extern (storage class) variable and it's declared static outside of
the function it will have internal linkage.
If it's an extern and it's declared outside of the file it will have external linkage.

(c)
True. Variables that are static with internal linkage will have a static storage duration.

(d)
True. Parameters have block scope for the function they belong to. This is because function
parameters are a local copy of the variable passed in, so they get block scope with automatic
storage.
