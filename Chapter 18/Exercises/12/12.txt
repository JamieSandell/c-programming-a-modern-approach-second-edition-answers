(a) Write a complete description of the type of the function f, assuming that it's declared as
follows:

int (*f(float (*)(long), char *))(double);

f is a function that has two arguments, a pointer to a function with a long argument that returns float.
The second argument is a pointer to a char. It returns a pointer to a function that takes a double and
returns an int.

(b) Give an example showing how f would be called.

float function1(long n);

char c = 'h';
char *cp = &c;
float (*fp)(long) = &function1;

int result = (f(function1, cp))(3.14);
