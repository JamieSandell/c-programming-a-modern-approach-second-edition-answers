Which of the following declarations are legal? (Assume that PI is a macro that represents
3.14159.)

(a) char c = 65;
(b) static int i = 5, j = i * i;
(c) double d = 2 * PI;
(d) double angles[] = {0, PI / 2, PI, 3 * PI / 2};

(a) Legal.
(b) Illegal. In C, static variables must be initialised using constant literals. If you
attempt to initialize a static variable with a non-constant value or an expression that
cannot be determined at compile time, the program will indeed fail to compile.
(c) Legal.
(d) Legal.
