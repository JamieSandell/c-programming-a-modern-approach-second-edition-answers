Extend the round_nearest function so that it rounds a floating-point number x to n dig-
its after the decimal point. For example, the call round_nearest(3.14159, 3) would
return 3.142. Hint: Multiply x by 10n, round to the nearest integer, then divide by 10n. Be
sure that your function works correctly for both positive and negative values of x.

double round_nearest(double x, int n)
{
    int power = pow(10, n);
    return x < 0.0 ? ceil(x * power - 0.5) / power : floor(x * power + 0.5) / power;
}
