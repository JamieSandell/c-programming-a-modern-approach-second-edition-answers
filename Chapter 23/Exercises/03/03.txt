(C99) Check the documentation for your compiler to see if it performs contraction on arith-
metic expressions and, if so, under what circumstances.

In GCC, when FP_CONTRACT does not disallow floating point expression contraction, then, flags -ffc-contract=fast, -funsafe-math-optimizations or -ffast-math must be used.
