Replace the test condition in the following if statement by a single call of strstr:

if (strcmp(str, "foo") == 0 || strcmp(str, "bar") == 0 ||
    strcmp(str, "baz") == 0) ...

Hint: Combine the string literals into a single string, separating them with a special chara-
cter. Does your solution assume anything about the contents of str?

if (strstr("foo!bar!baz", str) != NULL) ...

It assumes a null terminated string is being passed in. It also assumes the special character isn't in str.
