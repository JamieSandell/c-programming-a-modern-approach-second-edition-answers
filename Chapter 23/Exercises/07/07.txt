Section 23.6 explains how to call strchr repeatedly to locate all occurrences of a charac-
ter within a string. Is it possible to locate all occurrences in reverse order by calling
strrchr repeatedly?

Yes.

void capitalise_all_js(char *s)
{
    s = strrchr(s, 'j');

    while (s != NULL)
    {
        *s = 'J';
        s = strrchr(s + 1, 'J');
    }

    return;
}
