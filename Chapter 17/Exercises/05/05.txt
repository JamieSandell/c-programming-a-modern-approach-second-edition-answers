Suppose that f and p are declared as follows:

struct {
    union {
        char a, b;
        int c;
    } d;
    int e[5];
} f, *p = &f;

Which of the following statements are legal?

(a) p->b = '    ';
(b) p->e[3] = 10;
(c) (*p).d.a = '*';
(d) p->d->c = 20;

(a) Illegal, should be p->b.d.b = ' ', but that would also be illegal as it's multiple spaces, so multiple characters.
(b) Legal.
(c) Legal.
(d) Illegal, should be p->d.c = 20;
