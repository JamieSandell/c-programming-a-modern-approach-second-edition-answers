(a) Year followed by day of year: YYYY-DDD, where DDD is a number between 001 and
    366
(b) Year, week and day of week: YYYY-Www-D, where ww is a number between 01 and
    53, and D is a digit between 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sun-
    day
(c) Combined date and time: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss

Give strftime strings that correspond to each of these formats.
