Explain the meaning of the following statement, assuming that value is a variable of type
long int and p is a variable of type char *:

value = strtol(p, &p, 10);

Converts the value pointed to by p to a long int and stores it in value.
The second parameter is the endptr and if it's not NULL will point to the next character after the number.
Third parameter is the base.
