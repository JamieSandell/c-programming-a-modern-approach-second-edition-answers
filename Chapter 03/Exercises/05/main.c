/*
Suppose that we call scanf as follows: 

n = scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j); 

(i. j. and n are int variables and x is a float variable.) Assuming that the input stream 
contains the characters shown, give the values of i, j. n. and x after the call. In addition, 
indicate which characters were consumed by the call. 

(a) 10*20*30D 

(b) 1.0*2.0*3.00 
(C) 0.1*0.2*0.30 
(d) . 1* .2* .30
