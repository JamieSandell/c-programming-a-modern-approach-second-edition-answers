/*
Suppose that str is an array of characters. Which one of the following statements is not
equivalent to the other three?

(a) *str = 0;
(b) str[0] = '\0';
(c) strcpy(str, "");
(d) strcat(str, "");

a, b, and c assign the null character to str.
d is the odd one out, it appends the null character to the end of str.
