Find the error in the following program fragment and show how to fix it.

FILE *fp;

if (fp = fopen(filename, "r")) {
    //read characters until end-of-file
}
fclose(fp);

The error is that fclose is executed even if the file failed to be opened for reading.
To fix it exit if error:

FILE *fp;

if (fp = fopen(filename, "r")) {
    //read characters until end-of-file
}
else {
	
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
fclose(fp);
