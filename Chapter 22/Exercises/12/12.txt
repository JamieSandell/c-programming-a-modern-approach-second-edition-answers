Find the error in the following function and show how to fix it.

int count_periods(const char *filename)
{
    FILE *fp;
    int n = 0;

    if ((fp = fopen(filename, "r")) != NULL) {
        while (fgetc(fp) != EOF)
            if (fgetc(fp) == '.')
                n++;
        fclose(fp);
    }
    return n;
}

fgetc gets a character from the file and then advances the pointer.
So it's advanced (skips a character) by 1 when checking for EOF,
then it checks (and advances) and increments the counter if it found
a '.' in the file.

If the file contents were
..

it would only count 1 '.'.
