Which one of the following calls is not a valid way of reading one character from the stan-
dard input stream?

(a) getch()
(b) getchar()
(c) getc(stdin)
(d) fgetc(stdin)

(a) getch isn't part of the C standard (normally found in curses.h / conio.h).
It also differs from the others in that it reads directly from the keyboard, not a buffer/stream.
