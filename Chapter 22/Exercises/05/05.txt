Is there any difference between the printf conversion specifications %.4d and %04d? If
so, explain what it is.

No, they're equivalent.
%.4d

d is the specifier (integer) and .4 is the precision, which will result in an integer
with 4 significant characters printed.
%04d says pad with leading 0s, and 4 is the field width and d the specifier (integer.)
