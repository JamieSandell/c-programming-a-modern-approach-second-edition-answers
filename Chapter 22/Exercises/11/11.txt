The following loop appears in the fcopy.c program:

while ((ch = getc(source_fp)) != EOF)
  putc(ch, dest_fp);
Suppose that we neglected to put parentheses around ch = getc(source_fp):

while (ch = getc(source_fp) != EOF)
  putc(ch, dest_fp);
Would the program compile without an error? If so, what would the program do when it's run?

It would compile but != takes precedence of =.
getc(source_fp) is compared with EOF, and the result of that would be assigned to ch,
not the character read from the file. It would still check for EOF in the file correctly.
