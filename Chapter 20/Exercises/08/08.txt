Let f be the following function:

unsigned int f(unsigned int i, int m, int n)
{
    return (i >> (m + 1 - n)) & ~(~0 << n);
}

(a) What is the value of ~(~0 << n)?
(b) What does this function do?

(a) This turns all the bits for the number 0 from being 0 to 1,
shifts the bits left by n and then flips (complements) the (bits) result.

(b) This function takes a number (i) and from bit position (m + 1 - n)
upto bit position (m + 1 - n) + n. So, if you called it like this:
f(3782134647, 8, 12);

this would return the bits from bit 8 upto (inclusive) bit 12.
