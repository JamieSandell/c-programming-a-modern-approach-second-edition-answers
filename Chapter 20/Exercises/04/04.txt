In computer graphics, colors are often stores as three numberes, representing red, green and
blue intensities. Suppose that each number requires eight bits, and we'd like to store all three
values in a single long integer. Write a macro named MK_COLOR with three parameters (the
red, green and blue intensities). MK_COLOR should return a long in which the last three
bytes contain the red, green and blue intensities, with the red value as the last byte and the
green value as the next-to-last byte.

#define MK_COLOR(red, green, blue) ((long) (blue) << 16 | (green) << 8 | (red))
