If n is an unsigned int variable, what effect does the following statement have on the
bits in n?

n &= n - 1;

Hint: Consider the efect on n if this statement is executed more than once.

n = (n & (n - 1))

Example: n = 5

00000101 (5) &
00000100 (4) =
00000100 (4)

next run through
n = 4

00000100 (4)
00000011 (3)
00000000 (0)

the least significant bit is removed each time.
