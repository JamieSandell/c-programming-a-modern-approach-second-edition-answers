Describe a simple way to "toggle" a bit (change it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). Illustrate the
technique by writing a statement that toggles bit 4 of the variable i.

Use the exclusive-or operator alongside a mask of the bit you want to toggle.
E.g., oggle the 4th bit on the right of i:

i ^= 1 << 4;
