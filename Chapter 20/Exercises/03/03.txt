Explain what effect the following macro has on its arguments. You may assume that the
arguments have the same type.

#define M(x,y) ((x)^=(y), (y)^=(x), (x)^=(y))

This macro will swap the values of two variables without the need for a third temporary
variable.

For instance lets say we have two variables x and y with the following values:
x = 23 (decimal), 10111 (binary)
y = 12 (decimal), 01100 (binary)


x = x ^ y:
10111
     ^
01100
     =
11011, x is now 11011 (27 in decimal)


y = y ^ x:
01100
     ^
11011
     =
10111, y is now 10111 (23 in decimal)


x = x ^ y:
11011
     ^
10111
     =
01100, x is now 01100 (12 in decimal)

x is now 12
y is now 23
