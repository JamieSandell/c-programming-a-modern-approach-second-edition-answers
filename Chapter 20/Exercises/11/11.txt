Each of the following macros defines the position of a single bit within an integer:

#define SHIFT_BIT 1
#define CTRL_BIT  2
#define ALT_BIT   4

The following statement is supposed to test whether any of the three bits have been set, but it
never displays the specified message. Explain why the statement doesn't work and show
how to fix it. Assume that key_code is an int variable.

if (key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT) == 0)
    printf("No modifier keys pressed\n");

== takes precedence over &, so it's if (key_code == 0 & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT)), to fix it add brackets:
if ((key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT)) == 0)
    printf("No modifier keys pressed\n");
