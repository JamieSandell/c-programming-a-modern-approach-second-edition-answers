The following function supposedly combines two bytes to form an unsigned short integer.
Explain why the function doesn't work and show how to fix it.

unsigned short create_short(unsigned char high_byte, unsigned char low_byte)
{
    return high_byte << 8 + low_byte;
}

+ takes precedence over <<, so it's actually doing:
return high_byte << (8 + low_byte);

add brackets to fix:
unsigned short create_short(unsigned char high_byte, unsigned char low_byte)
{
    return (high_byte << 8) + low_byte;
}
